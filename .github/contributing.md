# Contributing

## Issues

When opening an issue:

* include the version you are using (see APP_VERSION or github tags)
* describe steps to reproduce the problem
* ideally link to a repo containing a minimal app exhibiting the issue

Better more information than less :)

## Pull requests

Please open an issue before investing time. We can then discuss if the feature
fits our roadmap and how to best integrate it.

Trivial pull requests are of course welcome (i.e. typos, small fixes, ...)

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the cdq-server project and assign the copyright of
those changes to the original author of cdq-server, Michael Prilop.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you
away from contributing.
